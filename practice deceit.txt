“I am the truth,” said Sufi Hallaj,
And they put him to death.
It’s dangerous enough to tell the truth
If you are the truth, you’d better keep your trap shut.
Even then, the truth would escape from your eyes,
And form a halo over you.
Larks would alight on you, 
And they would nest in your beard.
You’d be like the man in Lear’s limerick.
Practice deceit. It’s safer.
